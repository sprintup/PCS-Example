		<h3> Bio </h3>
				<p>Currently 28 year old starting out into the development world. I've always had an interest in computers and have made more time for it now that I've graduated from Portland State University and completed my commitment to the Oregon Army National Guard. I've accumulated enough points to be ranked in the top 500 of over 250,000 on teamtreehouse.com, a computer development training website. I'm also an accomplished triathlete training for my second IRONMAN. I'm interested in projects that will allow me to hone my skills so that I can make this into a career.</p>
