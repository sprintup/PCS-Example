		<h3> About </h3>
		<p>Hi, my name is Stepehen Printup and ever since I was young I've had a passion for computers. I remember daydreaming of one day owning my own laptop, while I pretended to type on the back seat of my grandfather's van. I've fiddled with different computer projects for many years, however it wasn't until I was a bit older that I realized just how much development and design resonates with me. I enjoy figuring out how to make a project work using the available properties. Not everyone thinks this process is as exciting as I do and a comparison that I can draw is that it is a bit like cooking to me. The different languages and values are like ingredients and the receipes are instructions, but the chopping, heating and preparing is my chance to be creative. I'm interested in using my skills toward projects that people are passionate about, so please feel free to contact me through twitter. Have a great day! </p>
